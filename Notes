Notes of python:

alway use print() function with parenthesis for output
python evalute the total value while doing expresions
python is high level, intrepreted, interactive, object oriented scripting language.
It has fewer syntatical contruction.
python is case sensitive lang
python is intrepreted programing lang because it executes the code line by line.
it is processed at runtime by the intrepreter so no need to compile before executing

write code --> interpreter ( runtime proceesed) --> execute program

It supports the object oriented style and technique of programming that encapsulated code within the object.
oops helps to reduce the complexity and also improves the maintainability of the system when combined with the concept of encapsulation and polymorphism
Easy to learn
easy to read
easy to maintian
a braod statement library
interactive mode4
portable
extendable
database support
gui programming
scalable

supports functional and structure programming methods as well as oops
used on scripting lang can be compiled to byte code for builidng large applicaiton
provide very highlevel dynamic data type and support dynamic checking
supports automation garbage collection
it can be easily intergrated with c, c++, java, cobra

python is Interactive and script mode programming (code executed in prompt shell >>>)

single leading underscore -> indicates indentifier is private ( _future = 10 )
double leading underscore -> indicates indentifier is strong private ( __future = 10 )
ends with two trailing underscore defined special name ( future___ = 20 )
