Notes of python:

alway use print() function with parenthesis for output
python evalute the total value while doing expresions
python is high level, intrepreted, interactive, object oriented scripting language.
It has fewer syntatical contruction.
python is intrepreted programing lang because it executes the code line by line.
it is processed at runtime by the intrepreter so no need to compile before executing

write code --> interpreter ( runtime proceesed) --> execute program

It supports the object oriented style and technique of programming that encapsulated code within the object.
oops helps to reduce the complexity and also improves the maintainability of the system when combined with the concept of encapsulation and polymorphism
